# Idris Full Stack DDD NodeJS example

## Order Taking Service

Idris version of Domain Modeling Made Functional Book.

 The [Domain Modeling Made Functional by Scott Wlaschin](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Domain-Modeling-Made-Functional-Domain-Driven/dp/1680502549)
introduces domain driven design and shows how well it fits to the world of functional programming via the lens of
the F# programming language. As Scott showed us that DDD is indeed a nice fit for functional programming,
questions arise naturally; could we push further the abstractions if we use a dependently typed programming language, like Idris?
Where are the sweet spots of depedent types in the world of everyday programming?
 Everyday programming needs to be focused on delivery, maintanability, reliability, and being correct.
The sad truth is that many applications needs to be more maintanable than correct.
Being correct is not a clear concept because its meaning changes as the software evolves.
In many cases, stakeholders only get a deeper understanding of the domain as the software solution/product evolves over time.
In this setting, depedent typed programming helps us achieve maintanability rather than being correct.
 In this repository I show a simple layered architecture and I show how to use simple dependent types
to draw explicit connections between the high level design of a service and its NodeJS deployed implementation.
Ideas and practices originated, but reshuffled from the [Type Driven Development with Idris by Edwin Brady](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Type-driven-Development-Idris-Edwin-Brady/dp/1617293024)
and the [Domain Modeling Made Functional by Scott Wlaschin](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Domain-Modeling-Made-Functional-Domain-Driven/dp/1680502549). This architecture includes; An abstraction to
talk about Bounded Context and Workflow, type safe description of a state transition system,
a free monad approach for domain implementation, and an actual implementation of the domain on NodeJS back-end.
 Because of dependent types, this architecture becomes explicit, rather than implicit, meaning that
the software developer really implements the `: BoundedContext OrderTaking -> Promise ()` function which is not
realizable in other programming technologies to the best of the author's knowledge.
 Idris could immensely benefit from simple FFIs for NodeJS libraries. The FFIs would grant access to thousands
of libraries from the NodeJS ecosystem almost for free. This approach would position Idris to be used even
in production settings and the Idris userbase could be bootstrapped, later the Idris version of these
libraries could be written.


## Setup

For dependencies install `nodejs`, `npm` and packages:

```
npm install google-closure-compiler
npm install sqlite
npm install md5
```

To start the OrderTaking service, which will create the initial Sqlite DB and starts
the service on `127.0.0.1:3000`

```
make start-opt
```

Have fun!
